            <b>My name is Jimmy Turtels:</b> 
            I founded this band and founded it. I have a crippling amount of credit card debt. I will never recover from the financial decisions that I have made. I play the keytar. Do you know how much a keytar costs? I didn’t, because I bought it with my credit card. It has cost me everything. The Turtles are good.

            <b>My name is Rin Turtels:</b>
            She is a professional of finishing homework right before the deadline. Born in Japan, she was grown with strict parents. But now she is free. She developed the skill called “procrastination” when she got to be a teenager. Now she is in Berklee College of Music in Boston and learning how to draw a treble clef. She is also a avant-garde piccolo player.
