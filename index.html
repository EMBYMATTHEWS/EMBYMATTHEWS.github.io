            <b>My name is Jimmy Turtels:</b> 
            I founded this band and founded it. I have a crippling amount of credit card debt. I will never recover from the financial decisions that I have made. I play the keytar. Do you know how much a keytar costs? I didnâ€™t, because I bought it with my credit card. It has cost me everything. The Turtles are good.
